# Pre Machine Learning

## Story Time

What motivated me to build this repository was the excitement of building something that could "remember" what it had "learned".

I was upset that every program I wrote had to be configured at every start up, so I built some nifty software that could remember configurations and preferences.

Then I realised "what is the point of remembering if you don't improve on what you know".
Thus, since I was a fan of the Houseâ„¢ series, I decided to build something that could see a lot of cases then tell the probability of a new patient having a specific disease. 

Thus, that is what I am trying to build here.


## Tech specs

### Dataset

The dataset I am using is available in [here in this Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)


### The scripts

To run the scripts you must have Python 3.1 or later. If you don't have Python [get it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
